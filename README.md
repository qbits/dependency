# dependency

Direct port of https://github.com/stuartsierra/dependency, which
deserves all the praise.

A data structure for representing dependency graphs in Pixie.

This library provides a basic implementation of a directed acyclic
graph (DAG) data structure, represented as a pair of maps. It is
immutable and persistent.

Nodes in the graph may be any type which supports Pixies's equality
semantics such as keywords, symbols, or strings.

## Installation

With [dust](https://github.com/pixie-lang/dust), add the following to
your project.edn `:dependencies`:

```clojure
[qbits/dependency "0.1.1-alpha"]
```

## Usage

    (require '[qbits.dependency :as dep])

Create a new dependency graph:

    (def g1 (-> (dep/graph)
                (dep/depend :b :a)   ; "B depends on A"
                (dep/depend :c :b)   ; "C depends on B"
                (dep/depend :c :a)   ; "C depends on A"
                (dep/depend :d :c))) ; "D depends on C"

This creates a structure like the following:

         :a
        / |
      :b  |
        \ |
         :c
          |
         :d

Ask questions of the graph:

    (dep/transitive-dependencies g1 :d)
    ;;=> #{:a :c :b}

    (dep/depends? g1 :d :b)
    ;;=> true

Get a topological sort:

    (dep/topo-sort g1)
    ;;=> (:a :b :c :d)

Refer to the docstrings for more API documentation. Refer to the tests
for more examples.
